    "In the context of brain networks in this study, every brain region is a node, whereas the connection between nodes is an edge. Colored shaded regions correspond to modules which are groups of interconnected nodes but have fewer connections to other modules. On the left, the concept of network segregation is presented as a network comprising of multiple modules (or segregated subnetworks) whereas, on the right, the network integration is illustrated as a group of distant regions interconnected by long‚Äêrange connections via connector hubs (nodes with a high degree of connectivity). The choice of nodes and edges can be influenced by the anatomical parcellation schemes and measures for determining connectivity. Some of the connections are direct, while others are indirect (to pass from one to another, the signal has to travel via another node).\n",
