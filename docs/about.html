  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I am a clinical neurologist at the University Hospital Bonn and an affiliated research associate at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). In both research and in clinical practice, I focus on the discovery of biomarkers and explanation of pathological cognition in neurodegenerative diseases (primarily LBD, AD, and ALS/FTD). My long-term goal is to position myself as a translation-al neuroscientist, creating a link between problems that are brought up by clinicians and answers given by basic science. </p>
