    <p>I am a clinical neurologist at the University Hospital Bonn and 
     an affiliated research associate at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). 
     In both research and in clinical practice, I focus on the discovery of biomarkers and explanation of pathological patterns through mathematical models in 
     neurodegenerative diseases (primarily LBD, AD, and ALS/FTD). Being a translational neuroscientist, 
     I create a link between problems that are brought up by clinicians and answers given by basic scientists. Furthermore, I strongly believe in freedom of information (not only) in research. Therefore, dedicate myself to 
   bringing principles of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/images/monitor/science-nav.png">open science</a> to the clinical research community (to make it more reproducible, robust and inclusive).</p>
