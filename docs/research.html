    <h3>My research (explained to an non-expert audience)</h3>
    <p>As a translational researcher I focus on bringing scientific discoveries back to the patients and also receive research ideas 
     from my clinical work. I dedicate myself to the research and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. 
     These are diseases in which neurons progressively lose their function and die. Typical representatives of these diseases are <a href="https://knowingneurons.com/2018/12/06/alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank">Alzheimer's 
     disease</a>, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. I evaluate  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078627/" target="_blank">biomarkers</a>; these are tools that allow us to detect these diseases earlier 
     (which is necessary to apply preventions and early therapies). Furthermore I am interested in bringing digitalization into the medical world in a way that is best for patients and healthcare workers.</p>
